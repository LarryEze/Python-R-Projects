There are many [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`.\n","\n","Recall that **CSV**, **TSV**, and **Excel** files are three common formats for storing data. \n","Three files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n","\n","**data/airbnb_price.csv**\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n","- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is located\n","\n","**data/airbnb_room_type.xlsx**\n","This is an Excel file containing data on Airbnb listing descriptions and room types.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`description`**: listing description\n","- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire homes/apartments\n","\n","**data/airbnb_last_review.tsv**\n","This is a TSV file containing data on Airbnb host names and review dates.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`host_name`**: name of listing host\n","- **`last_review`**: date when the listing was last reviewed\n","\n","Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:\n","\n","- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?\n","- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?\n","- How many adverts are for private rooms?\n","- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"id":"1fdc5784-479e-46cb-b05b-68439dcc94a7","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"executionTime":81,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":true},"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# We've loaded your first package for you!
